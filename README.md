## 🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition System
Organization: ProDigy Infotech
Project: Hand Gesture Recognition from Images using Machine Learning

---
## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a hand gesture recognition model capable of identifying and classifying different hand gestures from image data.
The model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Recognize multiple hand gestures from images
- Train a machine learning model for gesture classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Leap Motion Hand Gesture Recognition
- 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog

# 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TQDM

## 🧪 Methodology
- 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Load images from folders
Resize to 64×64 pixels
Convert to grayscale
Flatten into 1D feature vectors
- 2️⃣ Model Training
Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Split dataset into train (80%) and test (20%)
Apply StandardScaler for feature normalization
- 3️⃣ Evaluation
Accuracy score
Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

# ✅ Results 
Accuracy: 0.98475
